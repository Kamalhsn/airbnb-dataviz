        "### 🔹 Market Size and Host Activity\n",
        "\n",
        "* Bangkok has more than double the number of listings (23,273) compared to Berlin (9,264), but only slightly more hosts (6,669 vs 5,255).\n",
        "\n",
        "* This indicates that hosts in Bangkok tend to manage more properties per host, suggesting a more commercialized hosting market compared to Berlin.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🔹 Neighbourhood Concentration of Listings\n",
        "\n",
        "* In Berlin, listings are spread across many neighbourhoods (138), but top areas like Alexanderplatz, Frankfurter Allee Süd, and Tempelhofer Vorstadt have the highest concentration, indicating tourism and transit-connected zones attract more listings.\n",
        "\n",
        "* In Bangkok, listings are highly concentrated in fewer neighbourhoods (50), with Vadhana, Khlong Toei, and Huai Khwang alone accounting for a large share of total listings.\n",
        "\n",
        "* This shows that Bangkok’s Airbnb market is more geographically concentrated, while Berlin is more evenly distributed across districts.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🔹 Room Type Distribution\n",
        "\n",
        "* In both cities, Entire home/apartment dominates the market:\n",
        "\n",
        "Berlin: 73.5% entire homes\n",
        "\n",
        "Bangkok: 70.9% entire homes\n",
        "\n",
        "* Private rooms form about one-quarter of listings in both cities.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Shared rooms and hotel rooms together make up less than 3% in both markets.\n",
        "\n",
        "* This indicates that Airbnb in both cities is primarily used for full-property short-term rentals rather than shared accommodation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🔹 Pricing Patterns and Outliers\n",
        "\n",
        "* Median prices are much lower than mean prices in both cities:\n",
        "\n",
        "  Berlin: median ≈ 104, mean ≈ 201\n",
        "\n",
        "  Bangkok: median ≈ 1,379, mean ≈ 2,529\n",
        "\n",
        "* Extremely high maximum prices (Berlin: 50,000, Bangkok: 1,000,000) and very large standard deviations show the presence of strong price outliers, likely luxury or incorrectly priced listings.\n",
        "\n",
        "* This suggests that average price alone is misleading, and median price is a more reliable indicator of typical listing cost.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🔹 Review Activity (Demand Indicator)\n",
        "\n",
        "* Berlin listings have significantly higher engagement:\n",
        "\n",
        "  Median reviews: 14 (Berlin) vs 4 (Bangkok)\n",
        "\n",
        "  Mean reviews: 60 (Berlin) vs 23 (Bangkok)\n",
        "\n",
        "* In Bangkok, 25% of listings have zero reviews, indicating many new, inactive, or low-demand listings.\n",
        "\n",
        "* In both cities, a small number of listings receive extremely high reviews (over 2,900), showing that demand is highly concentrated in a few popular properties.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🔹 Availability and Market Saturation\n",
        "\n",
        "* Average availability is high in both cities, especially in Bangkok:\n",
        "\n",
        "  Berlin: 216 days available per year\n",
        "\n",
        "  Bangkok: 278 days available per year\n",
        "\n",
        "* Median availability in Bangkok is 318 days, meaning most listings are available most of the year and are not frequently booked.\n",
        "\n",
        "* This indicates strong oversupply, especially in Bangkok, where demand is spread across very few high-performing listings.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🔹 Combined Demand vs Supply Insight\n",
        "\n",
        "- Berlin shows better balance between demand and supply, with higher review counts and slightly lower availability.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Bangkok shows higher supply with lower demand, reflected by low reviews and very high availability.\n",
        "\n",
        "- This suggests that in Bangkok, only specific neighbourhoods and property types attract consistent bookings, while many listings struggle to receive guests."
